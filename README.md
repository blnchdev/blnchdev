### About

I reverse malware and mess with Win32 internals. Most of my work involves writing tools for dynamic analysis, syscall hooking, and various stealth techniques. Also prototype anti-cheat bypasses and exploitation methods when I'm bored.

Been writing C++ for 5+ years, comfortable with x86/x64 assembly and NT internals. Spend most of my time in IDA Pro or debugging some cursed Windows behavior.

### Projects

**[Aether](https://github.com/blnchdev/Aether)** - Dynamic syscall wrapper for Win32. Grabs syscall numbers at runtime so your code works across different Windows versions.

**[Wraith](https://github.com/blnchdev/Wraith)** - Steals existing process handles instead of opening new ones. Turns out most detection tools only watch for new handle creation.

**Zephyr** *(WIP)* - DLL manual mapper with multiple methods of control flow hijacking.

**Currently working on:**
- Memory dissector borrowing features from various analysis tools (a modern replacement to ReClass)
- DLL manual mapper
- Kernel Driver manual mapper
